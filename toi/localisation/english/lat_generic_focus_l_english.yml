 LAT_generic_Keep_Farms_desc:0 "We must keep the plantations if we are to keep the slaves working and productive. If we do not, then they will sit around and do nothing for the economy."
 LAT_generic_Postpone_Liberation_Acts_desc:0 "The liberation acts that certain parties are pushing must be blocked at all costs in order for slavery to return."
 LAT_generic_Undo_Black_Rights_Laws_desc:0 "The blacks will never be able to be sent back to the fields if we do not take their rights away. It is imperative that we take these rights away so that they can become slaves again."
 LAT_generic_Reintroduce_Slavery_desc:0 "We have finally managed to reintroduce the system of slavery that was abolished not so long ago. However, the anarchists and the blacks are not so happy, and will probably revolt."
 LAT_generic_Industry_Slaves_desc:0 "Many industries must have slaves integrated into them for slavery to truly come back. However, the progressive United Kingdom and France will not approve of such a movement."
 LAT_generic_Support_Cotton_Farmers_desc:0 "In the increasingly turbulent US, southern cotton farmers are at the risk of their slaves being taken away, so we must help these fellow slavers. However, the United States will not approve of this decision."
 LAT_generic_Support_CSA_desc:0 "The new nation, the Confederate States of America, is at war with the United States, and is at a large risk of losing its citizens' rights to own slaves. We must help our comrades in the southern United States to defeat the abolitionist Northerners."
 LAT_generic_Campesiono_desc:0 "The slaves must be focused on being campesionos or farm workers in our many plantations across the nation."
 LAT_generic_Slave_Base_Economy_desc:0 "To immerse ourselves in slavery and slave-owning in general, we must make our economy based on the work of slaves, so that our own people will not have to work so hard."

 LAT_generic_Soldiers_Keep_Slaves_Down_desc:0 "We must send soldiers to each of the plantations to make sure that the slaves fail in rebelling, or don't even plan to rebel. We will need to train the soldiers faster to keep up with the amount of plantations."
 LAT_generic_Better_Rifles_for_Keeping_Oppression_desc:0 "We must give the soldiers who are at the plantations better rifles so that they can easily put down rebelling or rebellious slaves. We will need to quickly research these better rifles before we have a giant slave rebellion."
 LAT_generic_Human_Slaves_desc:0 "We must enslave the black members of the population that are not yet slaves to maintain the unity of the nation and to reduce the amount of time it takes to build things even more."
 LAT_generic_Expand_Fields_desc:0 "The already existing fields must be expanded even more so that there is more space to have industry on and to have slaves work on."
 LAT_generic_Keep_Slavery1_desc:0 "There must be a final affirmation that we will keep slavery and that we will never stray from that path. Although some people will flock to the anarchists because they don't like this decision, the stability of the country overall will improve."
