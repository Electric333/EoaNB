nic.8.a:0 "The Nicaraguan Democrats"
nic.8.b:0 "During our initial occupation of Nicaragua, we allied with the Nicaraguan Democrats, helping them overthrow their conservative enemies, with whom they had long struggled, without either side gaining a decisive advantage. Their support was valuable during the first half of our previous expedition, however after our botched attempt to gain legitimacy through elections, many including President Rivas defected to the enemy. Now, though some are collaborating, most major figures have taken arms against us. While this may seem to be unsolvable, some may be willing to compromise, such as Maximo Jerez, who was formerly our foreign minister and was exiled to a post in Nicaragua by Tomas Martinez, conservative junta leader. However, we may also decide to rely purely on our own manpower and eschew the help of these traitors"
nic.8.c:0 "Let us compromise with Jerez"
nic.9.d:0 "We shall not deal with traitors"
nic_a_strike_against_cholera:0 "On our first expedition, our men were ravaged by the asiatic cholera because of a lack of regard for sanitary conditions, however we did not learn our lessons, and once again, our men dying like flies. However, if we use native laborers to help sanitary conditions, and stop our revelries for a time, we may be able to keep death to a minimum."
