 worldnewsfl.11.d:0 "Breaking news from Europe and America! After years of seemingly fruitless attempts since 1857, today Mr. Charles T. Bright and his expeditionary group of engineers and mechanics of the Atlantic Telegraph Company have successfully managed to lay a telegraphic cable along the seafloor of the Atlantic Ocean!\n\nUsing funding from both British and American governments, the cable was layed using decommissioned warships HMS Agamemnon and USS Niagara and stretches from Valentia Island in Ireland to Heart's Content in Newfoundland.\n\nThe line was inaugurated with congratulations exchanged between Queen Victoria and US President James Buchanan. The line ties the world yet closer, managing to send messages in a matter of minutes instead of days when word traveled by ship."

 worldnewsfl.41.d:0 "Terrible news from Indonesia! Just today, a violent eruption of proportions never seen before has exploded from the vulcanic island of Krakatoa!\n\nThe activity around the island the previous years, though intense, was not suggesting of the events now unfolding. Barometers around the world were able to record the shockwaves seven times as they traveled along the earth's surface, a testament to the explosion's power. Reports from the region suggests the eruption could be heard from as far as Perth, Australia, and managed to burst the eardrums of sailors as far as 63km from the detonation.\n\nThe vulcanic eruption has proved deadly for the unfortunate inhabitants of Sebesi, having been drowned by an ensuing harbourwave. Authorities are still finding and counting the bodies, and an estimate of 20000 - 30000 casualties has been reported."

 worldnewsfl.61.t:0 "Tunguska Explosion"
 worldnewsfl.61.d:0 "A violent explosion has been reported from the wast Siberian forests of Russia!\n\nThe cold winds of Siberia turned unexpectedly to smoldering fire in a flash over the taiga of Tunguska some days ago. Strange eye-witness accounts from locals who saw the event state that the explosion was caused by a massive object falling from the skies at break-neck speeds, with a light so strong it dimmed the sun as it burned in its flight. The ensuing collision into the Tunguska taiga have reportedly flattened an area as great as 2,150 square kilometers, and an estimated 80 million trees. Despite the great power of the explosion, no impact crater or trace of the impact has been observed or found.\n\nThough the event has so far only claimed 3 lives, it has raised awareness of the question of meteor protection across the world and precautions are beginning to take place."
