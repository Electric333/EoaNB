 finland.14.t:0 "The river of Taipaleenjoki"
 finland.14.d:0 "Originally, the waters of the Suvanto, a 40 kilometre-long lake in Viipuri Province, gently flowed into the Vuoksi River through the Kiviniemi waterway and emptying into the vast Lake Ladoga. In 1818, a channel had been dug to drain the spring floodwaters from the Suvanto into Lake Ladoga. However, this unexpectedly had caused the formation of a whole new river, the Taipaleenjoki. This new river has in recent years begun to drain Lake Suvanto of its contents, decreasing its water level by 7 meters and drying out the Kiviniemi waterway. Today the village of Sakkola dug a new riverbed through the Kiviniemi between the convergence of the Vuoksi River and Lake Suvanto. Unfortunately, this has inadvertently caused the stream to reverse in direction, causing the formation of a new river rapid called the Vuoksi Falls and rendering the navigation of the Kiviniemi impossible."
