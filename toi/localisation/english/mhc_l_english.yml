 mhc.11.t:0 "[Root.GetCurrentVotedReform]"
 mhc.11.d:0 "The members of our parliament have assembled, but the usually quite lively debate is nowhere to be heard. Instead, worried whispers fill the room, a man with a rifle in each corner, watching. Glances are exchanged again and again, and yet no one dares to stand up and voice their opinions, at least no one of real importance. Representatives from each faction are brought forward, but each and every time only a forcefully patriotic speech is read aloud."

 mhc.13.d:0 "Chaos befalls our government. As the military continues to blockade our efforts of governing [ROOT.GetNameDef], our homeland we hold dear, everything has grinded to a halt. The parliament is held at gunpoint, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s current location is still unknown and arguably the worst thing: our neighbours can't help but laugh.\nAll things considered, we expect this situation to go on for multiple months."
 mhc.13.a:0 "We stand humiliated..."
 mhc.14.t:0 "Military Junta Over"
 mhc.14.d:0 "These past few months have been hard on us. The military has grown in power and the government was forced to watch. Still, the worst seems to have passed, as the military has successfully achieved what they were striving for. Still, the junta has left behind noticeable effects we now have to face.\nNot to mention this may or may not have been the last time the military has messed with the government. Given the chance, they are sure to do so again."

Such a junta would blockade our government, making it impossible to pass laws on our own, essentially freezing any political processes within our dear [ROOT.GetName].\nBut, there may still be a silver lining on the horizon. The high brass of the Army has a proposal for us: they can take care of the incoming junta for us. The [MHC_INCOMING_JUNTA]'s power would take a hit in the process, however we should be aware that certain after effects such as political chaos would still apply.
